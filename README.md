# Resume-Builder-With-ATS-Optimizer
A web application where job seekers can easily create professional resumes and instantly check their ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score to optimize their chances of getting shortlisted.

**Long Description**

The Resume Builder with ATS Optimizer is a web-based application designed to help job seekers create professional resumes that truly stand out. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can customize resumes with multiple templates that follow industry standards.

What makes this project unique is its built-in ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimizer. Since many companies use ATS software to filter resumes before they reach recruiters, this tool analyzes the resume content and provides an ATS Score. The score helps users understand how well their resume aligns with job descriptions and relevant keywords.

By combining resume creation with ATS optimization, this project empowers job seekers to not only design visually appealing resumes but also improve their chances of getting shortlisted in the hiring process.
